## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Juno follows a modular, service-oriented architecture that separates concerns and improves maintainability:

### Main Process (Backend)
- **WindowManager**: Unified window management for main app and overlay windows
- **RecorderService**: Orchestrates audio recording with specialized sub-modules:
  - **MicrophoneManager**: Handles microphone permissions and device selection
  - **AudioLevelAnalyzer**: Processes audio data to detect levels and silence
  - **BackgroundAudioController**: Controls background audio (pause/resume)
- **AIService**: Manages AI interactions with OpenAI's models
- **DictionaryService**: Maintains custom word dictionary for improved transcription
- **ServiceRegistry**: Manages service lifecycle and dependencies

### Renderer Process (Frontend)
- React-based component architecture
- Custom hooks for stateful logic
- Secure IPC communication with the main process
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- sox (Sound eXchange) - Required for audio recording
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install sox

  # Linux
  sudo apt-get install sox

  # Windows
  # Download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/
  ```
- OpenAI API key for AI features

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahorihuela/juno.git
   cd juno
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your OpenAI API key in the settings

### Development

Run in development mode with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Run in production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Controls
- **Start Recording**: Double-tap ‚åò+‚áß+Space (Command+Shift+Space)
- **Stop Recording**: Single-tap ‚åò+‚áß+Space or press Escape
- **Cancel Recording**: Press Escape

### AI Commands
1. Start recording
2. Say your trigger word (default: "Juno") followed by a command
   - Example: "Hey Juno, summarize this"
3. Or use action verbs directly
   - Example: "Translate this to Spanish"

### Settings Configuration
1. Open the Settings page
2. Configure:
   - OpenAI API key
   - AI model selection
   - Temperature settings
   - Trigger word
   - Custom rules
   - Action verbs

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Run critical path tests only:
```bash
npm run test:critical
```

## üì¶ Building for Distribution

Create distribution packages:
```bash
npm run dist
```

This will create platform-specific installers in the `dist` directory:
- macOS: `.dmg` and `.zip`
- Windows: `.exe` (NSIS) and portable
- Linux: `.AppImage` and `.deb`
