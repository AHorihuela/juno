# Juno Application Fixes - Command Recognition & Text Formatting

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. AI Command Recognition Improvements
- **Problem**: Voice commands to Juno and action verbs were not being reliably detected
- **Fix**: Enhanced `AICommandDetector.js` with:
  - Extended trigger word detection to check the first 5 words (up from 3)
  - Added support for more prefix words before the trigger word
  - Added detection of action verbs within common phrase patterns
  - Improved phrase detection by checking sentence fragments
  - Added more robust command pattern matching

### 2. Text Formatting Enhancements
- **Problem**: Transcribed text had poor formatting (no commas, paragraphs, proper capitalization)
- **Fix**: Enhanced `WhisperAPIClient.js` text formatting with:
  - Automatic capitalization at the start of every sentence
  - Proper capitalization of common proper nouns (days, months, product names)
  - Improved spacing around punctuation marks
  - Added paragraph breaks for longer texts
  - Better preservation of natural text structure

### 3. AI Service Method Detection
- **Problem**: Unreliable AI command processing due to method availability issues
- **Fix**: Updated `transcriptionService.js` to:
  - Check for both `processCommand` and `processRequest` methods
  - Dynamically choose the available method
  - Added support for different response formats
  - Improved error handling with better user feedback
  - Enhanced logging for debugging issues

## Testing
These changes should make voice commands work more reliably and produce better formatted text output. To test:

1. Try using different command formats:
   - "Juno, summarize this"
   - "Hey Juno can you explain this"
   - "Summarize this paragraph"
   - "Please rewrite this text"

2. Check text formatting improvements:
   - Proper capitalization of sentences
   - Better punctuation spacing
   - Paragraph breaks in longer text
   - Capitalization of proper nouns like "Juno"
