## Guidelines for Technical Fix Documentation

When documenting technical fixes:

1. Clearly describe the original problem
2. Explain the implementation of the fix
3. Include relevant code snippets
4. Detail any testing procedures
5. Add recommendations for future improvements

This documentation helps maintain institutional knowledge about the codebase and provides context for future development.
