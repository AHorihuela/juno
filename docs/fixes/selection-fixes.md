# Juno Selection Handling Fixes

## Issue Identified
Selected text from applications is not being reliably passed to the AI component when users trigger Juno or action verbs. This prevents the AI from working with the correct context.

## Root Causes
1. **Selection Retrieval Issues**: The SelectionService was not robust enough in retrieving selected text, with no fallback mechanisms when the primary method failed
2. **Single-Attempt Selection**: The code only made a single attempt to get selected text, which is unreliable as selection can sometimes fail silently
3. **Missing Error Handling**: When selection failed, it silently proceeded with empty text without notifying the user
4. **No Clipboard Integration**: There was no fallback to clipboard-based selection when other methods failed

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. TranscriptionService (processAndInsertText method)
- Added multiple attempts to retrieve selected text when first attempt fails
- Added a delay between attempts to improve success rate
- Added clipboard fallback when other selection methods fail
- Added informative notifications for users when selection is unavailable
- Enhanced logging of selection contents and state
- Added detailed logging of parameters passed to AI service

### 2. SelectionService (getSelectedText method)
- Implemented cache checking to reuse recent selections
- Added proper debouncing to avoid multiple parallel selection attempts
- Added context-aware selection with app name for better strategy selection
- Added parallel fallback strategies when primary selection method fails
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the selection process
- Maintained cached selections for recovery when new selection attempts fail

## Testing Recommendations
To verify these fixes are working properly:

1. **Selection Test**: Select text in various applications (browsers, text editors, etc.) and trigger Juno with commands like:
   - "Juno, summarize this"
   - "Juno, explain this code"
   - "Rewrite this paragraph"

2. **No Selection Test**: Try commands without selecting text to verify proper notifications

3. **Application Switching**: Test selecting text, switching to another app, then triggering Juno to see if it properly retrieves the selection

4. **Rapid Commands**: Issue multiple commands in quick succession to test the debouncing logic

These changes significantly improve the reliability of selected text detection and provide better user feedback when selection cannot be retrieved.
