# Juno Application Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. TranscriptionService Service Access Issue
- **Problem**: The TranscriptionService was trying to access `this.services.get('textInsertion')` but `this.services` was undefined
- **Fix**: Changed all instances of `this.services.get()` to use the BaseService's `this.getService()` method, which properly accesses the service registry

### 2. AppNameProvider Initialization Issue
- **Problem**: The TranscriptionService was attempting to use `this.appNameProvider` without initializing it
- **Fix**: Added proper initialization in the `_initialize()` method:
  - First attempts to use the AppNameProvider from SelectionService
  - Falls back to creating its own instance if needed
  - Provides a simple fallback for error cases

### 3. Dual Service Registration Issue
- **Problem**: Both "RecorderService" and "Recording" services were being initialized separately
- **Analysis**: 
  - The primary service is `RecorderService` (registered as 'recorder' in the ServiceRegistry)
  - The secondary `RecordingService` appears to be a legacy or compatibility layer
  - Both are being initialized, which could lead to duplicate functionality and conflicts

## Implementation Details

### TranscriptionService Fixes
```javascript
// Changed from:
const aiService = this.services.get('ai');
// To:
const aiService = this.getService('ai');
```

### AppNameProvider Initialization
```javascript
// Added to TranscriptionService._initialize:
try {
  // Try to get it from the SelectionService first
  const selectionService = this.getService('selection');
  if (selectionService && selectionService.appNameProvider) {
    this.appNameProvider = selectionService.appNameProvider;
    logger.info('Using AppNameProvider from SelectionService');
  } else {
    // If not available, initialize our own instance
    const AppNameProvider = require('./selection/AppNameProvider');
    this.appNameProvider = new AppNameProvider();
    logger.info('Initialized standalone AppNameProvider');
  }
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to initialize AppNameProvider:', error);
  // Create a fallback provider that always returns 'unknown'
  this.appNameProvider = {
    getActiveAppName: async () => 'unknown'
  };
  logger.info('Using fallback AppNameProvider');
}
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Service Dependencies**: Consider updating the ServiceRegistry to track and verify dependencies between services
2. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling in service initialization methods
3. **Service Documentation**: Add better documentation for service relationships and expected interfaces
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for service initialization to catch these issues in the future
5. **Logging**: Enhance logging with more detailed information about service state during initialization
6. **Service Cleanup**: Consider removing or refactoring the duplicate RecordingService
