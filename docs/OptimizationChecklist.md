# Juno Optimization Checklist

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Tests
- [ ] Verify basic transcription works with correct results
- [ ] Confirm AI commands are properly detected and processed
- [ ] Test both "Juno" trigger word and action verb commands
- [ ] Verify highlighted text replacement works correctly
- [ ] Test text insertion in various applications
- [ ] Verify performance improvements are measurable
- [ ] Confirm second instance handling works correctly
- [ ] Test application startup time and initialization
- [ ] Verify log files contain detailed debugging information

### Performance Validation Tests
- [ ] Benchmark recording start time (target <200ms)
- [ ] Benchmark complete transcription time (target <1s)
- [ ] Benchmark AI processing time (target <2s)
- [ ] Benchmark text selection time (target <200ms)
- [ ] Benchmark text insertion time (target <300ms)
- [ ] Compare results against baseline (pre-optimization)
- [ ] Verify memory usage stays within expected ranges
- [ ] Test CPU utilization during peak operations

### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Test behavior when no speech is detected
- [ ] Test recovery from network errors
- [ ] Test handling of permission issues
- [ ] Test recovery from AppleScript execution failures
- [ ] Test behavior when selection strategies timeout
- [ ] Verify clipboard recovery works correctly
- [ ] Confirm user notifications appear with fallback options

### Functional Tests by Component

#### Recording Component
- [ ] Test single-tap recording (short recordings)
- [ ] Test double-tap recording (long form dictation)
- [ ] Verify recording indicator shows correctly
- [ ] Test cancellation of recording
- [ ] Verify audio level indicators work properly

#### Transcription Component
- [ ] Test short phrase transcription accuracy
- [ ] Test longer dictation transcription accuracy
- [ ] Verify dictionary word substitutions work
- [ ] Test with various accents/speaking styles
- [ ] Verify transcription history is correctly saved

#### AI Command Component
- [ ] Test "Juno" trigger at start of phrase
- [ ] Test "Juno" trigger in second/third word position
- [ ] Test action verbs like "summarize", "improve", etc.
- [ ] Test with prefixes like "please", "hey", etc.
- [ ] Verify AI responses are properly formatted

#### Selection Service
- [ ] Test text selection in native macOS apps
- [ ] Test text selection in Electron apps
- [ ] Test selection of very large text blocks
- [ ] Verify selection works when rapidly switching apps
- [ ] Test behavior with no text selected

#### Text Insertion Service
- [ ] Test insertion in native macOS apps
- [ ] Test insertion in Electron apps
- [ ] Test insertion of very large text blocks
- [ ] Verify clipboard state is properly preserved
- [ ] Test multiple back-to-back insertions

### Cross-Platform Tests
- [ ] Verify basic functionality on macOS 12 (Monterey)
- [ ] Verify basic functionality on macOS 13 (Ventura)
- [ ] Verify basic functionality on macOS 14 (Sonoma)
- [ ] Test with different hardware configurations

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Internal Testing
- [ ] Deploy to development team
- [ ] Collect feedback and metrics
- [ ] Address any critical issues
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### Phase 2: Beta Testing
- [ ] Deploy to selected beta users
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Compare with pre-optimization metrics

### Phase 3: Production Rollout
- [ ] Update release notes with optimization details
- [ ] Prepare user documentation on new features
- [ ] Perform staged rollout to production
- [ ] Monitor metrics and logs in production
- [ ] Establish performance baseline for future optimization

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Average transcription time
- [ ] AI command processing time
- [ ] Error rates by component
- [ ] User-reported issues
- [ ] Clipboard-related errors
- [ ] AppleScript execution failures
- [ ] Selection strategy success rates

### Long-term Improvements
- [ ] Identify candidates for further optimization
- [ ] Consider direct Whisper API streaming
- [ ] Explore local models for basic commands
- [ ] Investigate more efficient selection methods
- [ ] Consider precompiling all AppleScripts on startup
