   - Test with different recording lengths

2. **AI Command Processing**
   - Test "Juno" trigger in different positions (first, second, third word)
   - Verify action verb triggers work correctly
   - Test with articles and prefixes ("please summarize", "the rewrite")

3. **Highlighted Text**
   - Test with highlighted text in different applications
   - Verify replacement works correctly
   - Test with different lengths of highlighted text
   - Verify selection service correctly identifies text in various apps

4. **Text Insertion**

   - Verify retry mechanism works correctly

### Performance Tests

1. **Measure and compare initialization times**
   - Recording start time (target <200ms)
   - Complete transcription time (target <1s)
   - AI processing time (target <2s)
   - Text selection time (target <200ms)
   - Text insertion time (target <300ms)

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Test behavior when no speech is detected
   - Test recovery from network errors
   - Test handling of permission issues
   - Test recovery from AppleScript execution failures
   - Test behavior when selection strategies timeout
