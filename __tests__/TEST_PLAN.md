# Juno Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy and plan for the Juno application. It serves as a guide for current and future testing efforts to ensure the application's reliability, maintainability, and correctness.

## Testing Goals

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify that all features work as expected
2. **Prevent Regressions**: Catch issues before they reach production
3. **Improve Code Quality**: Use tests to drive better code design
4. **Document Behavior**: Tests serve as executable documentation
5. **Enable Refactoring**: Allow safe refactoring with confidence

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Test individual components, services, and functions in isolation.

**Focus Areas:**
- Service methods
- Utility functions
- React component rendering
- State management

**Tools:**
- Jest
- React Testing Library

### Integration Tests

Test interactions between components and services.

**Focus Areas:**
- IPC communication
- Service interactions
- Component interactions
- Workflow sequences

**Tools:**
- Jest
- Mock Electron APIs

### End-to-End Tests (Future)

Test complete user workflows in a production-like environment.

**Focus Areas:**
- User journeys
- Cross-component workflows
- Performance
- Actual Electron behavior

**Tools:**
- Spectron or Playwright
- Actual Electron instance

## Test Coverage Targets

| Component Type | Target Coverage |
|----------------|----------------|
| Core Services  | 80%+           |
| UI Components  | 70%+           |
| Utilities      | 90%+           |
| IPC Handlers   | 80%+           |

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Set up testing infrastructure
- Create mock implementations
- Develop test helpers
- Create example tests
- Document testing approach

### Phase 2: Core Services

- Test service initialization and shutdown
- Test service methods
- Test error handling
- Test service interactions

**Priority Services:**
1. WindowManager
2. MemoryManager
3. AIService
4. NotificationService

### Phase 3: IPC Communication

- Test IPC handlers
- Test IPC events
- Test error handling in IPC
- Test renderer-to-main communication

### Phase 4: UI Components

- Test component rendering
- Test component interactions
- Test state management
- Test user interactions

**Priority Components:**
1. Main application window
2. Settings panels
3. Memory management UI
4. Notification components

### Phase 5: End-to-End Testing (Future)

- Set up end-to-end testing infrastructure
- Test key user journeys
- Test cross-component workflows
- Test actual Electron behavior

## Testing Standards

### Naming Conventions

- Test files: `[component-name].test.js` or `[component-name].test.jsx`
- Test suites: Describe the component or feature being tested
- Test cases: Describe the specific behavior being tested

Example:
```javascript
describe('MemoryManager', () => {
  describe('Memory Operations', () => {
    it('should add item to working memory', () => {
      // Test code
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Structure

Each test should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the test environment and inputs
2. **Act**: Execute the code being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the results

Example:
```javascript
test('should add item to memory', () => {
  // Arrange
  const memoryManager = new MemoryManager();
  const item = { text: 'Remember this' };
  
  // Act
  memoryManager.addToMemory(item);
  
  // Assert
  expect(memoryManager.workingMemory).toContain(item);
});
```

### Mock Usage

- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Reset mocks between tests
- Be explicit about mock behavior
- Avoid excessive mocking

## Continuous Integration

Tests will be run automatically on:
- Pull requests
- Merges to main branch
- Release builds

## Resources

- [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Electron Testing](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/testing)

## Maintenance

This test plan should be reviewed and updated:
- When adding major new features
- When changing the application architecture
- Quarterly to ensure it remains relevant
